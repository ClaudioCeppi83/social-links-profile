## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working on this project, I improved my understanding of Flexbox and CSS custom properties. For instance, I learned how to center elements both horizontally and vertically using Flexbox:

```css
body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    background-color: var(--neutralOffBlack);
    font-family: var(--primaryfont);
    font-size: 1.4rem;
    margin: 0;
    height: 100vh;
}

I also gained a better understanding of managing layout and styling for responsive design.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:

- Enhancing my skills with CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Exploring CSS animations and transitions for better interactivity.
- Improving accessibility features in my web projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This is a great resource for learning about various web technologies and best practices.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This site provided valuable insights into Flexbox and CSS custom properties.
